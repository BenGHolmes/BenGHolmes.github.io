				Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a third year student at the University of British Columbia, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Physics, a highly competitive program that focuses on developing a foundation of high level math and physics knowledge, while also allowing me to customize my degree with a wide range of technical electives.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently, I have become fascinated by the field of data science - specifically it's applications to the world of business and finance. I think that attempting to model and predict such a complicated system would be an exciting challenge, and would fit well with the type of problem solving that I enjoy and excel at. I've taken my first steps towards a career in this area by taking online courses in statistics, data analysis, and financial modeling. I've applied the skills that I've learned to several projects on Kaggle, and to a data science competition hosted by UBC's Sauder School of Business. You can see more details about these on my projects page.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm still exploring my options in these fields, so if you're interested in collaborating on a project or sharing your experience in data science, finance, or management consulting, I'd love to connect. Please reach out to me on LinkedIn! A link to my page is in the site menu.
