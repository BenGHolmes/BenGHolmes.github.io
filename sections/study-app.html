                During my first year of university, I always found it difficult to know what topics I should be reviewing and when I should
                be reviewing them. When I was looking for study techniques to use, I stumbled across spaced repetition, which
                is a technique for reviewing flashcards. The basic idea is that you place your flash cards into different
                piles depending on how frequently you need to review them: daily, every other day, weekly, bi-weekly, or
                monthly. When you get a flash card correct, it moves up a pile, increasing the amount of time before you
                see it again. If you get one wrong, it moves back to the daily pile. This spaced repetition of topics has
                been shown to greatly improve long term retention of material and seemed like a great technique.

                The problem with the traditional method of spaced repetition is that it only really works when you have flash cards. As an
                engineering student, most of my courses focus on applying concepts rather than memorization; these types
                of courses can't be reviewed using flash cards. My solution to this was to create an app that would store
                all of the topics that I cover in all of my classes, and periodically remind me to review them. Rather than
                a binary right/wrong like you have with the flash card method, my app simply asks how well you feel like you
                understand the material, and adjusts the time between review sessions according to your response. When the
                review session comes around, you are free to use whatever method works best for you. It allows people
                to use the study techniques that work best for them, while making the most of their time by providing a clear,
                daily study plan.
