                Lately, I've been fascinated with machine learning, and I've been looking for a project that will let me learn the basics
                of it. While researching possible projects, I found a well-documented self-driving car platform called Donkey
                Car, and based my project on this. The brains of the car is a Raspberry Pi, and the steering and throttle
                are controlled by a set of 4 relays.

                Currently, I am able to drive the car from my laptop using the arrow keys by recording the inputs, and sending them to the
                car's Raspberry Pi through a RabbitMQ queue. As I continue to work on this project, I plan to add a wide-angle
                fisheye lens and feed the images into a neural network in order to have the car drive itself. Similar to
                the Donkey Car projects, I plan to train the neural net by having it observe me driving several laps of a
                track. After processing the video of my laps, I will have a model that attempts to emulate my driving. From
                there, I plan to create new models for different tasks such as object avoidance, and localization to allow
                the car to figure out which room of my house it's currently in.
