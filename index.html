          <p>I'm generally not that great at talking about myself, but for those interested I'll give it my best shot.</p>
          <p>I have two somewhat contradictory passions. My first is for the outdoors where I try to spend as much time as
            possible skiing or climbing. I love the feeling of disconnecting and being completely stress free, surrounded
            for kilometers by nothing but trees and rocks, or snow. My other passion is for engineering and technology,
            and I try to undertake as many projects as I can, in order to push myself, expand my knowledge and apply what
            I've learned. I love the feeling of stress that comes from having too many interesting projects on my plate.</p>
          <p>I'm still learning how to balance these aspects, but in the mean time I created this website to share what
            I'm working on. My hope is that this website will allow me to connect with other people who love to build and
            create, or inspire others to start projects of their own.</p>
