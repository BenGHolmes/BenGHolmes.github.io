                    Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a fourth year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia, with a passion for using software and math to solve challenging and exciting problems! This has lead me to pursue a career in data science and machine learning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've taken my first steps in that direction by taking several online courses, working for a semester as a quantitative analyst for a commodities trading company, and agreeing to ship myself to Denmark this coming fall, to take a semester of machine learning and data science courses at DTU. I'm also trying to put what I've learned into practice by taking on some personal projects (more about those below). If you're interested in collaborating, or sharing your experience in either of these fields over coffee, don't hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In what little free time I have between classes and extracurricular projects, I'm an avid climber, skier, and backpacker, and I dabble in biking, running and photography. I also enjoy cooking and good craft beer.

                                    I spent a year as a mechanical engineering team member on UBC Solar, a student design team building and racing 100% solar powered cars. While on the team, I design mounting brackets for the front suspension and steering rack using SolidWorks, and fabricated them with a waterjet cutter. I also performed finite element analysis for the rear suspension using Ansys, to ensure the car would survive a 1G turn and a 2G bump, and wrote a significant portion of the mechanical design report justifying our design decisions. My last project with the team was to work in a multidisciplinary team to design the car's battery safety box, which had a specific mechanical, electrical and ventilation requirements.

                                    First machine learning project! As part of a project course, we were tasked with building an autonomous robot capable of navigating a complex course and retrieving stuffed animals along the way. My team and I decided to take a risk for the sake of learning something cool, and decided to use computer vision to detect the stuffed animals, which had never been attempted before in that course.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I spearheaded the implementation of the computer vision system. After tesing several of our own networks in Keras, we deciced to use the extremely fast YOLO (you only look once) network since it was the only one that could run on a Raspberry Pi at a decent frame rate. I then trained the network on ~2500 images, and wrote the Python code that took the network's predictions and converted them to a heading for our robot to follow.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since this was a large, multidisciplinary problem, I also had a hand in the mechanical design and fabrication, writing a PID algorithm for the motor controls, and designing an 8 bit digital to analog converter

                                    Recently, I've been really interested in the field of computational physics. In order to get some experience solving computational problems, I decided to implement the simulation outlined in <a href="https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/nastava/nmf/Lopta.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> by Tanner Morrison. The code was written in MATLAB and can be found on my github.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The code performs finite difference analysis to simulate the motion of both balls, and the result of any impacts that occur between them or the container around them. The weight of each ball and the initial position and velocity can all be set to vary the outcome. In the future, I hope to add in friction and rolling to make the model more accurate.

                                    The WikiGame is a game where players race to find the fastest path between two random Wikipedia pages by following links in articles. To guarantee that I always beat my friends, I decided to build a bot to play using a graph of all connected Wikipedia pages, rather than guessing what the fastest path is myself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I downloaded the latest Wikipedia XML dump (a 50GB xml file), pulled all the links from every Wikipedia page, and stored them in a SQL database for quick access during games. I then used Selenium to interact with the game itself and follow the links on the pages. When a game starts, the bot grabs the start and end pages, and does a breadth first search of the graph to find the 20 fastest paths between the two pages (you get extra points for repeated wins within the time limit). I then quickly follow the links, completing as many paths as possible within the two minute time limit. The bot regularly scores 5-10x higher than its human opponents.
