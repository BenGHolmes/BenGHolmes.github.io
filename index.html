                Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a third year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia in
                Vancouver, Canada. I have a passion for physics, software development, and math, and with my endless
                curiosity and love for problem solving, I hope to build a career in research and academia. I have taken
                my first step in this direction by pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics, an extremely competitive
                program that focuses on developing a foundation of high level math and physics knowledge, while also
                allowing me to customize my degree with a wide range of technical electives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, my main interest has been in the areas of theoretical physics, astronomy, and robotics.
                I'm currently gaining my first research experience through the UBC Research Experience Program, where
                I'm working in a group of four to explore the holographic principal similar to work by Hayden and Preskill.
                In the coming years, I hope to get more research experience in physics or robotics to help me narrow down my 
                areas of interest and guide my degree moving forwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                In what little free time I have between classes and extracurricular projects, I'm an avid climber,
                skier, and backpacker, and I dabble in biking, running and photography. I also enjoy cooking and good craft beer.

                    In order to improve my understanding of machine learning and computer vision, I've taken apart an old RC car and added a raspberry pi and a camera to it. My goal is to extend the work that I did on the autonomous rescue robot, in a personal project that doesn't have such a tight time constraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I've connected a Raspberry Pi to the RC car and successfully controlled both steering and the throttle by sending commands from my laptop to the Pi over wifi. My next steps will be to use what I learned from the rescue robot project to update the circuitry to allow for more precise steering and throttle controls, and to train a neural network to follow a taped course.

                    The WikiGame is a game where players race to find the fastest path between two random Wikipedia pages by following links in articles. To guarantee that I always beat my friends, I decided to build a bot to play using a graph of all connected Wikipedia pages, rather than guessing what the fastest path is myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I downloaded the latest Wikipedia XML dump (a 50GB xml file), pulled all the links from every Wikipedia page, and stored them in a SQL database for quick access during games. I then used Selenium to interact with the game itself and follow the links on the pages. When a game starts, the bot grabs the start and end pages, and does a breadth first search of the graph to find the 20 fastest paths between the two pages (you get extra points for repeated wins within the time limit). I then quickly follow the links, completing as many paths as possible within the two minute time limit. The bot regularly scores 5-10x higher than its human opponents, and you can find it at the very top of the scoreboard at <a href="https://www.thewikigame.com/group" target="_blank">thewikigame.com</a> (the username is "TheBeast").

                    Recently, I've been really interested in the field of computational physics. In order to get some experience solving computational problems, I decided to implement the simulation outlined in <a class="link" href="https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/nastava/nmf/Lopta.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> by Tanner Morrison. The code was written in MATLAB and can be found on my github.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code performs finite difference analysis to simulate the motion of both balls, and the result of any impacts that occur between them or the container around them. The weight of each ball and the initial position and velocity can all be set to vary the outcome. In the future, I hope to add in friction and rolling to make the model more accurate.

                    During this past summer, I participated in the yearly Engineering Physics robot
                    design course. The course is structured as a competition, with the goal being to build a fully
                    autonomous robot that is able to complete the given challenge in just 13 weeks. This year, we had to
                    rescue Ewoks (stuffed animals) from the Empire stronghold by navigating over gaps, differentiating
                    between various infrared light signals, and detecting and capturing 5 stuffed Ewoks along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the beginning, our team decided that we wanted to try to implement a universal solution, that required no hardcoding or prior knowledge of the course. In order to achieve this, I implemented a computer vision system that allowed us to navigate directly from Ewok to Ewok, without needing to look for specific course landmarks. A Raspberry Pi on the robot continuously captured images of the course ahead using a fisheye camera, and these photos were processed using a Python implementation of the extremely fast <a class="link" href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/" target="_blank">YOLO</a> network, running on the Pi. The raspberry pi would then calculate how much the robot needed to turn in order to face the next Ewok, and then pass this information to our main STM32 microcontroller, which controlled the motors.

                    While working with UBC Solar, I had the opportunity to work independently and in groups to model components in AutoCAD and machine them using a water-jet cutter and a mill, perform finite element analysis using Ansys to evaluate the car's safety, and design the car's battery safety box.

                    My first engineering project at UBC was designing and building a folding cardboard chair. Our team was limited to just one square meter of cardboard and given the goal of supporting as much weight as possible. Our chair performed best in our class, successfully supporting 400 pounds' worth of sandbags!
