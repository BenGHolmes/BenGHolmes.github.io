								<H3>AlphaFour</H3>
								<p>Currently building a lightweight version of DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero algorithm to master Connect Four. You can follow my progress on Github below.</p>

								<h3>Hyperparameter Tuner</h3>
								<p>Fourth-year capstone project. Developed a hyperparameter tuner for a local fintech company, Finn AI. Written in Python and using Bayesian optimization under the hood.</p>
								<div class="hrule"></div>

								<h3>Autonomous Robot</h3>
								<p>Designed and built an autonomous robot from scratch in just four months. The robot used a version of the YOLO object detection algorithm running on a Raspberry Pi to navigate towards and retrieve targets scattered around a complex and dynamic course. More information about the challenge and my group's solution can be found at the link below.</p>

								<h3>Atari Pong Deep RL Agent</h3>
								<p>Using deep reinforcement learning to play Pong. Term project for a masters course on deep learing taken during an exchange semester at the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen. Used a novel approach for representing the game state and designing the network, rather than the standard CNN approach taken by a majority of my peers.</p>
								<div class="hrule"></div>

								<h3>Oh Hell Bidder</h3>
								<p>A probabalistic bidder for the card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell" target="_blank">Oh Hell</a>. Averages the results from thousands of random walks to determine an expected number of tricks taken, and then recommends a corresponding bid. Currently undefeated. See the code on Github.</p>

								</ul>
								<div class="hrule"></div>

								<h3>WikiGameBot</h3>
								<p>Used Java to parse a Wikipedia data dump and create a directed graph of all links between pages. Wrote a bot in Java that uses Selenium to play an online game where players race between two random Wikipedia pages by following links in the articles. Regularly scores 5-10x higher than its human opponents. See the code on Github.</p>

									<h2>Work</h2>
								</header>
								
								<h3>Specialized Bicycle Components</h3>
								<h4>Applied Technologies Intern | January 2020 - Present</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Used a dataset of over 6000 Strava rides to study temperature's effect on race performance and rider power output.</li>
									<li>Developed a physics model of our electric E-bikes to estimate battery range under a variety of conditions.</li>
									<li>Wrote a general algorithm for solving kinematics of any full-suspension bicycle using Newton-Raphson iteration. Reduced algorithm runtime by an order of magnitude compared to existing, bike-specific approach.</li>
									<li>Designed a new database for our R&D bike data and built a Go API for interfacing with it.</li>
									<li>Built a prototype digital bicycle pump with 0.1psi accuracy, signal processing to remove noise during pump strokes, and six-month battery life.</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="hrule"></div>

								<h3>Castleton Commodities</h3>
								<h4>Co-op Quantitative Analyst | May - August 2019</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Used Python and Dask to perform data exploration on a large dataset (over 100GB) to verify industry priors about freeze-offs â€” a poorly understood but crucial factor in the price of natural gas markets.</li>
									<li>Developed, trained, and validated machine learning models using Python and Scikit Learn to predict natural gas production as a function of multiple variables.</li>
									<li>Documented research process and results, and presented my findings to the data science and trading teams.</li>
									<li>Wrote Python script to process trade tick data into daily indexes that were more accurate than the ones given by the exchanges.</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="hrule"></div>

								<h3>Blue Willow Systems</h3>
								<h4>Co-op Software Engineer | January-May 2018</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Researched emerging localization technologies and wrote Python algorithms for a proof of concept that integrated the new technology with our existing system.</li>
									<li>Tested and iterated on filtering algorithms to reduce location error from 4 meters to less than 1 meter.</li>
									<li>Implemented front-end, back-end, and SQL database changes to production web and mobile applications which added new features including an incident report system and a company-wide announcements board for customers.</li>
									<li>Wrote a custom Android application that used bluetooth to showcase company technology during sales meetings when the full, cloud-based system could not be installed.</li>
