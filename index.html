        I have a passion for software development, circuits, physics, and math. Given my endless curiosity and love for problem solving, I hope to build a career in research and academia, or entrepreneurship. I have taken my first step in this direction by pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics, an extremely competitive degree that focuses on developing a foundation of high level math and physics knowledge, while also allowing me to take a wide range of technical electives in pursuit of my passions.

        In addition to my coursework, I am constantly coming up with ideas for new projects to work on. Right now I'm working on a self driving rc car that uses a raspberry pi, a camera, and machine learning to navigate a taped course, and an arduino based, hardware password manager that securely stores passwords offline, and automatically enters usernames and passwords when connected to a computer.

        I also have a number of non-technical hobbies including skiing, snowboarding, climbing, backpacking, and biking. I try to spend as much time as I can outdoors, when I'm not
