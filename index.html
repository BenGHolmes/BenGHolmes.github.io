                Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a third year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia in
                Vancouver, Canada. I have a passion for physics, software development, and math, and with my endless
                curiosity and love for problem solving, I hope to build a career in research and academia. I have taken
                my first step in this direction by pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics, an extremely competitive
                program that focuses on developing a foundation of high level math and physics knowledge, while also
                allowing me to customize my degree with a wide range of technical electives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, my main interest has been in the areas of theoretical physics, computational physics, and
                astronomy. I've recently taken courses in both quantum mechanics and special relativity, and they have
                been by far the most enjoyable courses of my degree. I hope to get more experience in physics research
                over the coming years to help me narrow down my areas of interest and guide my degree moving forwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                In what little free time I have between classes and extracurricular projects, I'm an avid climber,
                skier, and backpacker, and I dabble in biking, running and photography.

                    During this past summer, I participated in the yearly Engineering Physics robot
                    design course. The course is structured as a competition, with the goal being to build a fully
                    autonomous robot that is able to complete the given challenge in just 13 weeks. This year, we had to
                    rescue Ewoks (stuffed animals) from the Empire stronghold by navigating over gaps, differentiating
                    between various infrared light signals, and detecting and capturing 5 stuffed Ewoks along the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the beginning, our team decided that we wanted to try to implement a universal solution, that
                    required no hardcoding or prior knowledge of the course. If successful, our robot would be able to
                    navigate any similar style of course, even if the specific obstacles changed. My main contribution
                    was implementing a computer vision system that allowed us to do exactly that. A Raspberry Pi on the
                    robot continuously captured images of the course ahead using a fisheye camera, and these photos were
                    processed using a Python implementation of the extremely fast <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolov2/" target="_blank">YOLO</a> network, running on the Pi.
                    The raspberry pi would then calculate how much the robot needed to turn in order to face the Ewok,
                    and then pass this information to our main STM32 microcontroller, which controlled the motors.
                </p>

                    For a more detailed look at the design of our robot, check out the website that we made for it <a class="link" href="https://axel-jacobsen.github.io/ENPHRobot/" target="_blank">here</a>

                    Recently, I've been really interested in the field of computational physics. In order to get some experience solving computational problems, I decided to implement the simulation outlined in <a class="link" href="https://web.math.pmf.unizg.hr/nastava/nmf/Lopta.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> by Tanner Morrison. The code was written in MATLAB and can be found on my github.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code performs finite difference analysis to simulate the motion of both balls, and the result of any impacts that occur between them or the container around them. The weight of each ball and the initial position and velocity can all be set to vary the outcome. In the future, I hope to add in friction and rolling, to make the model more accurate.

                    During my first year at UBC, I was a member of the mechanical design team for UBC Solar, an engineering student team building a solar powered race-car for the Formula Sun Grand Prix.

                <p>
                    While working with UBC Solar, I had the opportunity to work independently and in groups to model components in AutoCAD and machine them using a water-jet cutter and a mill, perform finite element analysis using Ansys to evaluate the car's safety, and design the car's battery safety box.
