            <p>
                I have a passion for software development, circuits, physics, and math. Given my endless curiosity and love for problem solving,
                I hope to build a career in research and academia, or entrepreneurship. I have taken my first step in this
                direction by pursuing a degree in Engineering Physics, an extremely competitive program that focuses on developing
                a foundation of high level math and physics knowledge, while also allowing me to take a wide range of technical
                electives in pursuit of my passions.

                In addition to my coursework, I am constantly coming up with ideas for new projects to work on. Right now I'm working on
                a self driving rc car that uses a raspberry pi, a camera, and machine learning to navigate a taped course,
                and an arduino based, hardware password manager that securely stores passwords offline, and automatically
                enters usernames and passwords when connected to a computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In what little free time remains, I'm an avid climber, skier, and backpacker, and I dabble in biking, running and photography.
