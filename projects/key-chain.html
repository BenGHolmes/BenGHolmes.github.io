                Given some recent security issues surrounding online password managers, I decided to build my own solution that offered much
                more security without sacrificing the ability to conveniently auto-fill login pages. Inspired by the id card
                that my doctor uses to sign into her computer at work, I decided to build a hardware solution to this problem,
                and ended up settling on an arduino based USB stick. The USB stick is small enough to be kept in a pocket,
                so it is always with me, and the passwords are safely stored offline in the arduino's EEPROM memory.

                When the USB is plugged into a computer, I can select a login from the list of stored sites by using a directional pad
                on the device. While scrolling, the names of the sites stored on the device will be shown on a small OLED
                display on top of the device. Once the correct site is found, I can choose to display the password on the
                screen, or automatically fill the username, or password, or both. If I choose to automatically fill the
                username and/or password, the arduino emmulates a keyboard in order to enter the username and password for
                the selcted site.

                Currently, the only way to add new logins or update existing ones is using a python script that I wrote, but I am planning
                to create a chrome extension or app that uses the chrome serial api to update the device.
